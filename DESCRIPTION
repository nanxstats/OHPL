Description: OHPL implements the ordered homogeneity pursuit lasso (OHPL)
    algorithm for group variable selection proposed in Lin et al. (2017)
    <DOI:10.1016/j.chemolab.2017.07.004>. The OHPL method takes the
    homogeneity structure in high-dimensional data into account and
    enjoys the grouping effect to select groups of important variables
    automatically. This feature makes it particularly useful for
    high-dimensional datasets with strongly correlated variables,
    such as spectroscopic data.
